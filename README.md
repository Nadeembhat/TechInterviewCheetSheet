### Disclaimers

If you found a mistake (sorry!) or know a better way of doing/explaining something or if you think I may have missed out something important, please [post an issue](https://github.com/SuyashLakhotia/TechInterview/issues) or [submit a pull request](https://github.com/SuyashLakhotia/TechInterview/pulls)! :blush:

This repo is an assimilation of knowledge from various sources that I didn't completely keep track of when I was learning. So, if you found a resource I might have referenced and paraphrased (or straight up regurgitated) in this repo, please do let me know and I would be happy to add it to the growing list of [references](References.md).
